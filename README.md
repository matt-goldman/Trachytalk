# Trachytalk

Trachytalk is designed to help patients with a tracheostomy to communicate (or anyone who can't speak but can use a mobile device).

I decided to build this because my mother is in critical care. Most mobile devices can do this natively one way or another, but I've noticed that patients in this state don't have the visual acuity or dexterity to see the type or work the keyboard on a small screen. Other apps on the App Store are geared toward patients who are non-verbal due to a brain injury or neurodiversity, and feature symbols or common words. These are great but don't allow a normally verbal patient to communicate to the best of their ability.

Trachytalk instead features an almost full screen keyboard with big letters and easily lets the patient review their phrase (and remove any unwanted words) before speaking it.

It's pretty basic at the moment as I wanted to get a rapid prototype into my mum's hands as soon as possible, but I intend to update it with some additional features and stylingin the future.
